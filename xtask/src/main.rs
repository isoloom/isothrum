//! Isothrum's development tasks, run as `cargo run -p xtask -- <task>`, the same on macOS, Linux
//! and Windows:
//!
//! - `schema`: the event stream's JSON Schema, written to `crates/isothrum-runner/schema/`;
//! - `real-run`: an Isoloom example generated for Docker with the local Isoloom, then the ignored
//!   real-run test against it (up, status, check, park, resume, down), the event stream kept
//!   under `target/real-run/`; `real-run cloud <cloud>` runs solo-web on a cloud account whose
//!   credentials are in the environment (up, status, check, then down and reap whatever
//!   happened);
//! - `wasm`: the editor's engine built for the browser (`web/pkg/`), and with `--website <dir>`
//!   copied into the site's `public/wasm/`;
//! - `quality`: the ratchet, the clean-code counts per crate against `quality-baseline.json`;
//! - `test`: the tests under cargo-nextest, then the doctests;
//! - `msrv` and `features`: every crate checked with its declared minimum Rust, and with every
//!   combination of its features (cargo-hack);
//! - `fuzz`: the fuzz targets of `fuzz/` (cargo-fuzz), each for a while;
//! - `mutants`: mutation testing of the compiler and the runner's executor (cargo-mutants).
//!
//! Isoloom's `cargo xtask check-all --repos isothrum` runs them with the other gates. Each task is
//! a module; `process` runs the tools they drive, `repo` finds the checkout. `workspace` holds the
//! tests that keep the workspace's manifests and dependencies to the standard (PLAN 3b, 3d).
