# Changelog

All notable changes to Isothrum are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Isothrum is the runner (crate and CLI) and the lab-model compiler (drawing → spec)
plus its WASM build. It executes what Isoloom generates; it is shared by the Isothrum
desktop app, the isothrum.com editor and the Cyber CTF launcher.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-10-19

### Added

- The runner can hot-add the learner's attacker box to a running Compose lab that
  declares no on-demand access machine: it starts an ad-hoc container (the learner's
  image, else the default Kali image) on the lab network, reports its address, and
  removes it on detach. A lab that still declares an on-demand access machine keeps
  the existing Compose `access`-profile behavior. Vagrant and cloud targets are
  unchanged (ad-hoc attach there is not yet supported).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-18

The first stable release, paired with Isoloom 1.0. The `0.11.x` series on crates.io
were the release candidates. The public runner API changed in this release — see the
old→new symbol table in Isoloom's
[`docs/migrating-to-1.0.md`](https://github.com/isoloom/isoloom/blob/main/docs/migrating-to-1.0.md)
and the note below.

### Added

- **Cloud and the egress seal.** The runner drives the cloud Terraform targets and applies
  the manifest's optional `seal` step once the environment is ready (a second apply that
  drops the default route and limits egress to the lab's own CIDRs). The seal fails
  closed: a failed seal means the run is not ready. Sensitive Terraform outputs are
  masked.
- **A stable `ErrorCode` surface.** The embedder-facing error codes are a
  `#[non_exhaustive]` enum, each with a snake_case serde name that round-trips. An
  exhaustive, compile-guarded test now covers every variant (adding or removing one fails
  to compile), so the codes can't drift.
- **`ssh.run` with a bounded wait.** SSH steps accept a `wait_s` (capped at 1800) for a
  booting cloud VM's first connection, and the Terraform driver copies the generated module
  before applying it.

### Changed

- **Domain-neutral run API.** Isothrum is a general-purpose runner, so the CTF/courses word
  "lab" is gone from the public API and the internal vocabulary:

  | 0.x | 1.0 |
  |---|---|
  | `Lab<'r>` (from `Runner::open`) | `Running<'r>` |
  | `status::Run` (the up/resume result) | `Started` |
  | `LabView` (the hook view) | `RunView` |
  | compiler `LabFile` | `ProjectFile` |
  | CLI `LabArgs` | `TargetArgs` |
  | `LabArgs.lab` (its path field) | `TargetArgs.path` |
  | the `lab` module | `run` |

  The public types are now `Runner` (`open` returns `Running<'r>`), `Running<'r>`,
  `Started` and `RunView<'a>`.
- **Reads the manifest's `environment:` key.** The runner consumes the run manifest's
  renamed top-level provenance key (`lab:` → `environment:`, same shape). The committed
  event schema and the fixtures are regenerated accordingly.

### Notes

- The CLI operations are unchanged in shape: `up` (with `--replace` and `--lifetime`),
  `park`, `resume`, `status`, `check`, `provision` and `down`, run against the manifest
  Isoloom writes at `<run>/.isoloom/<target>/run.json`.
