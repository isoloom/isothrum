//! Isothrum's compiler: a project as drawn in the editor (a [`Topology`]: machines, the LANs drawn
//! around them, and the cables between their ports) becomes an Isoloom spec, in the format Isoloom
//! reads (`isoloom.yml`, version 1).
//!
//! - **Machines.** A container node is a custom app from its image (`app.image`), kept running
//!   idle with its own `command` when the image runs nothing of its own; a Cisco node is an
//!   appliance (`app.appliance`). A VM node is its OS (`os`), set up by its provisioning steps
//!   (`app.steps`), or the OS alone: each target decides how to deliver it.
//! - **Ports** are named (`ssh`, `http`, `port-8000`, `dns-udp`), each with its `protocol`.
//! - **Networks.** A LAN (an area drawn on the canvas, a VLAN in practice) is an Isoloom network
//!   with its own block; each machine on it gets an address there, the next free one unless it
//!   asks for one. A cable between two machines is its own point-to-point network (a /29 cut from
//!   `10.200.0.0/16`, the two ends on its first two usable addresses). A switch's VLANs nest
//!   under a network named after the switch.
//! - **Routing.** An automatic router lets the networks it joins reach each other (`reach`, both
//!   ways); a Cisco router is its LANs' gateway.
//!
//! Every compiled spec is read back by Isoloom's parser before it is returned, so what the
//! compiler hands out is a spec Isoloom reads. Whether the project is valid as a whole (an unattached
//! machine, overlapping blocks) is Isoloom's validation to say.
//!
//! A Windows machine's own steps are PowerShell scripts: the Ansible playbooks drawn on one run
//! from Isoloom's controller (`provision:`), as Isoloom's own Windows examples do.
//!
//! The project's own files come with the spec ([`Compiled::files`], as [`ProjectFile`]s): the appliances'
//! configurations, and a starter for each provisioning step to edit, so a downloaded project runs as
//! is.
//!
//! The modules follow [`compile`]: the drawing as read (`topology`); its `machines` and their
//! `ports`; the playbooks Isoloom's `controller` runs; the `lans` and their addresses, the
//! `cables`, the `routers` and the switches' `vlans`; the spec as it is built (`draft`) and
//! written (`document`). `project` and `starters` are the project's own files; `error` is what a
//! drawing can get wrong.
//!
//! ```
