//! An `ssh.run` step with a `wait_s`: its host may still be booting (a cloud VM right after the
//! apply that made it), so a run that ssh itself couldn't connect for (exit 255, nothing printed
//! by the command) is tried again every [`RETRY`] until `wait_s` is spent. Only the connection
//! is retried: a command that ran and failed fails the step at once. ssh's own complaints are
//! held back while it can't connect, so the step's log is its command's.
