//! The Isothrum runner: executes the run manifest Isoloom writes next to a target's generated
//! files (`.isoloom/<target>/run.json`), and reads nothing else of them.
//!
//! The manifest holds the native commands in order, the documented driver actions, readiness,
//! outputs, check runners, and the slots inputs and secrets travel through. The runner adds what
//! only it can know: the run's name and private state, one operation per run at a time, the
//! values of params and secrets, and the event stream an embedder (the Cyber CTF launcher, the
//! Isothrum desktop app, the `isothrum` command line) shows. It sits between Isoloom (whose
//! `isoloom-manifest` crate is the contract) and those embedders, and depends on no UI.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Opening a manifest reads and checks it, and nothing runs yet:
//!
//! ```
//! use isothrum_runner::{RunName, Runner, RunnerConfig};
//!
//! let home = tempfile::tempdir()?;
//! let dir = tempfile::tempdir()?;
//! let manifest = dir.path().join("run.json");
//! std::fs::write(&manifest, include_str!("../tests/fixtures/flag-portal.run.json"))?;
//!
//! let runner = Runner::new(RunnerConfig::new(home.path()))?;
//! let run = runner.open(&manifest, Some(RunName::new("demo")?))?;
//! assert_eq!(run.manifest().environment.name.as_str(), "flag-portal");
//! assert_eq!(run.name().as_str(), "demo");
//! assert!(runner.runs()?.is_empty(), "no operation has run");
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Running it takes the tools it names (here Docker), and an event sink:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn demo(run: &isothrum_runner::Running<'_>) -> isothrum_runner::Result<()> {
//! use isothrum_runner::{JsonLines, Park, RunOptions};
//!
//! let events = JsonLines::new(std::io::stderr());
//! let opts = RunOptions::new().with_param("ISOLOOM_PUBLISH_FIXED", "1");
//! let started = run.up(&opts, &events).await?;
//! let report = run.check(&opts, &events).await?;
//! run.park(Park::Shutdown, &events).await?;
//! run.resume(&opts, &events).await?;
//! run.down(&opts, &events).await?;
//! # let _ = (started, report);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Ports
//!
//! Every outside effect goes through a port the embedder can replace: [`ProcessRunner`] (the
//! tools), [`HostPorts`] (the host's ports), [`Clock`] (the time), [`Events`] (where events go)
//! and [`Hooks`] (the embedder's sidecars). They are open traits on purpose, since embedders
//! implement them; the `fake` feature has test doubles for the first three.
//!
//! # Deliveries
//!
//! Params and slot values reach the tools only through the manifest's deliveries, never on a
//! command line: `env` (a step's variables), `tf_var` (`TF_VAR_<var>`, a `map_entry` making one
//! JSON object), `state_file` (an owner-only file in the run's state folder, a Terraform variable
//! file or `NAME=value` lines, written at `up`, kept for the destroy, removed by a successful
//! `down`), and `guest` over SSH, Isoloom's delivery into a machine for a cloud with no secret
//! store (DigitalOcean, Linode): once the step it names (else every `up` step) succeeded, one
//! SSH session per machine, to the outputs `address_<machine>` (`-` as `_`) and
//! `ssh_user_<machine>` (else `ssh_user`), runs a fixed script as root that keeps each value
//! owner-only under `/var/lib/isoloom/secrets/<slot name>` and then touches
//! `/var/lib/isoloom/secrets/.delivered`, which the machine's set-up waits for; the values travel
//! base64-encoded on its standard input, retried while SSH can't connect (up to 15 minutes).
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! The runner is **async**, on Tokio, chosen once for the whole crate: every tool runs as an async
//! process with a time limit (a step's `timeout_s`, else an hour; 25 s for a probe; two minutes
//! for an action's own Docker calls; ten for a hook), and dropping an operation's future ends the
//! process tree it started. Operations on one run are serialized; operations on different runs
//! run side by side. One exception to "no blocking call in async code": the run's state files (a
//! record, a lock, the pinned ports, the event log) are a few KB on the local disk, so they are
//! read and written inline rather than through `spawn_blocking`.
//!
//! # Errors and tracing
//!
//! Every fallible call returns [`Result`], whose [`Error`] has a stable [`ErrorCode`]; an
//! operation also reports its failure as its last event. The runner logs through `tracing` (spans
//! `run`, `step` and `driver`, events for each process), never by printing.
