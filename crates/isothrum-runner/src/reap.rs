//! The reaper's half in the runner, so an abandoned run can't keep billing:
//!
//! - [`Runner::expired`]: the recorded runs whose expiry passed and that may still hold
//!   something. Destroying one is its `down`, which replays the params it was applied with (the
//!   embedder gives the connection, as for any operation).
//! - [`Runner::orphans`]: what a cloud still holds tagged past its expiry that no recorded run's
//!   state covers, read through the cloud's own command line (its argv, never a shell). An orphan
//!   is only listed, never deleted: no state says what it belongs to, so a person removes it.
//!
//! The sweep's schedule is the embedder's (the launcher sweeps every five minutes; the
//! `isothrum reap` command once).
