//! One operation per run: this runner's own lock on it (an async mutex per run, held by the
//! [`crate::Runner`], never a process-wide static), then an OS lock on the run's `lock` file across
//! processes, which the OS releases when its holder dies (ported from the launcher's
//! `deploy_worker/lock.rs` and `runtime/inflight.rs`).
//!
//! The lock fails **closed**: a lock file that can't be opened or locked stops the operation. The
//! launcher's first lock carried on without it (`inflight.rs`), which is what the lock is there to
//! prevent (Terraform's own state lock is cleared on the assumption that this one is held).
