//! Taking over a Terraform deployment made before the runner: an embedder whose old runtime kept
//! its own state (the launcher's `deployments/<run>/<target>/`) hands it to the runner once, so a
//! player's running cloud run stays destroyable after the switch, by one code path (`down`, the
//! reaper).
//!
//! The deployment's state moves into the run's state folder (`terraform.tfstate`, and its
//! `.backup` when there is one), and the run's record says it is up, with the params it was
//! applied with: a later `down` replays them (the region it was created in, never the
//! embedder's current one). Terraform's data folder stays behind: it names the old state's path
//! as its backend, which a run's `init` would refuse to change without a prompt; `init` makes a
//! fresh one.
