//! Hot-adding the learner's attacker box into a running run, and hot-removing it. A lab no longer
//! declares an access machine, so the box is stood up ad hoc on the running lab's network with no
//! manifest or Compose machine behind it ([`crate::driver::Attacker::AdHoc`], Docker only).
//!
//! For backward compatibility, a lab that still carries an on-demand access machine (a manifest
//! machine marked `on_demand`, which the initial `up` left down — a Compose `access` profile, a
//! Vagrant `autostart: false`) keeps its old path: `attach` brings that machine up on a chosen
//! network with the learner's picked image, `detach` takes it back out.
